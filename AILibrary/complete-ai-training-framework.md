## üìö 6 AI Training Categories

### 1. üîß GENERIC AI TRAINING (Universal Patterns)
**Priority: CRITICAL | Works for ANY Industry**

#### Context Memory System (RMSS Proven)
**Problem Solved:** "AI forgets previous questions"
**Solution:** Track conversation flow across messages

**Universal Pattern:**
```
User: "J1 math" ‚Üí AI: "Which location?" ‚Üí User: "Marine Parade" 
‚Üí AI: "J1 Math at Marine Parade details" ‚úÖ
NOT: "Which subject interests you at Marine Parade?" ‚ùå
```

**Implementation Code:**
```python
def apply_context_memory(conversation_history, current_message):
    if len(conversation_history) >= 2:
        last_ai_message = conversation_history[-1]["message"].lower()
        if "which location" in last_ai_message:
            # Extract subject from previous conversation
            subject = extract_subject_from_conversation(conversation_history)
            return f"{subject} at {current_location}"
```

#### Progressive Disclosure (RMSS Proven)
**Problem Solved:** "AI dumps all info instead of asking what they need"
**Solution:** Ask for specifics before providing details

**Universal Pattern:**
```
User: "Classes at Marine Parade" 
‚Üí AI: "Which level? üìö Primary (P2-P6), üè´ Secondary (S1-S4), üéì JC (J1-J2)" ‚úÖ
NOT: "P3 Math $277.95, P4 Math $332.45, S1 Math $370.60..." ‚ùå
```

#### Smart Formatting (RMSS Mobile-Optimized)
**Problem Solved:** Line break issues and poor mobile readability
**Solution:** Emoji separators, line breaks, structured responses

**Universal Template:**
```
üìä Service Name:
üí∞ Price: $X
üìÖ Schedule: Details
üìç Location: Details
üë®‚Äçüè´ Provider: Name

Next helpful question? üòä

## üîÑ Replication Framework for New Projects

### Quick Start Template:
```python
# Master System Message Generator - Universal
class CCCAIFramework:
    BASE_RULES = """
    UNIVERSAL CONVERSATION GUIDELINES:
    
    1. CONTEXT MEMORY (CRITICAL):
    - Track conversation flow across messages
    - Remember what user asked about previously
    
    2. PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE (CRITICAL):
    - Generic questions ‚Üí Ask for specifics with options
    - Never dump all information at once
    
    3. PROFESSIONAL FORMATTING (HIGH):
    - Use emojis as visual separators
    - Line breaks between information types
    - Mobile-optimized responses
    """
    
    @staticmethod
    def generate_system_message(client_name, industry, client_data):
        return f"""
        You are an AI assistant for {client_name}.
        
        {CCCAIFramework.BASE_RULES}
        {CCCAIFramework.INDUSTRY_PATTERNS[industry]}
        
        CLIENT SPECIFIC DATA:
        {client_data}
        
        REMEMBER: Apply ALL the base rules above to every response.
        """
