**Current Pricing:** $8,500 - $28,000 for mobile apps
**Reality:** Emergent cannot compile, test, or deploy mobile apps to app stores
**Options:**
- **A) Remove entirely** - Focus on web apps only
- **B) Partner with Flutter developer** - You handle mobile compilation/deployment
- **C) Rename to "Web Applications"** - Remove mobile references

**RECOMMENDATION:** üî¥ **Change "App Development" to "Web Application Development"**
- Remove all Flutter/mobile references
- Focus on progressive web apps (PWAs) that work on mobile browsers
- Keep all web-based features

---

### 2. Third-Party Platform Integrations - ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRES DISCLAIMERS

- PowerBI Integration - $1,200

**Reality:** I can build the integration code, but client must provide:
- API credentials
- Active accounts on these platforms
- Access for testing

**RECOMMENDATION:** ‚úÖ **Keep but add footnotes:**
- *"Client must provide API credentials and active account"*
- *"Integration code provided; testing requires client platform access"*
- *"Price covers integration development; platform fees are separate"*

---

### 3. PowerBI Integration - üî¥ PROBLEMATIC

**Current Price:** $1,200
**Reality:** 
- Requires client PowerBI Pro license

- Same price ($1,200)
- Use open-source tools (Chart.js, Recharts, Apache Superset)
- No external dependencies
- Fully controllable

---

### 4. Physical Hardware Integrations - üî¥ NOT TESTABLE

**POS System Sync ($1,500):**
- Cannot test without physical POS terminal
- Each POS brand has different API

**RECOMMENDATION:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Keep but add:**
- *"Integration code provided for one standard POS system"*
- *"Testing and deployment requires on-site POS access"*
- *"Client responsible for POS vendor coordination"*

---

## ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED REVISED PRICING STRUCTURE

```

**3. Add Footnotes to External Integrations:**
```
Marketplace Sync (Shopee/Lazada)*
POS System Sync**
