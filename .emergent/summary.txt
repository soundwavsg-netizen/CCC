<analysis>
The AI engineer's work spanned several iterations, initially fixing data consistency and UI issues in the Tuition Centre chatbot. Key accomplishments included normalizing tutor names (removing A/B suffixes), refining LLM context handling to prevent information dumps, and enhancing the enrollment form with proper scrolling and navigation buttons. A major new project, the Math Results Analysis System, was then initiated and built from the ground up, featuring Firebase integration, CSV/PDF result uploads, an analytics dashboard, and a revision plan generator. Subsequent enhancements to this system focused on AI-powered PDF analysis (using GPT-4o vision), a comprehensive assessment generation flow with a dummy question bank, and a dynamic weak performance threshold for tutors. The process was iterative, responding directly to user feedback and progressively adding functionality while ensuring data integrity and a positive user experience.

<product_requirements>
The project involved two main products:

**1. Tuition Centre Chatbot Enhancement:**
*   **Data Accuracy:** Ensure tutor/class data from P2-J2 PDFs is accurate in Firebase, consolidating tutor profiles (e.g., Eugene Tan A into Eugene Tan). Fix specific data discrepancies (e.g., S3 AMath Bishan).
*   **Chatbot Intelligence:** Update LLM with 2026-2027 academic data. Enable Firebase querying for schedules, disambiguate tutors, maintain multi-turn context, prevent information dumps, and ask clarifying questions for broad queries (e.g., for missing location).
*   **UI/UX:** Resolve button contrast, ensure mobile responsiveness (chat bubbles, header), prevent page scrolling on message send. Improve enrollment form with a Cancel button and proper mobile scrolling.
*   **New Features:** Implement an enrollment/reservation form (user particulars, email notifications). Create a basic admin UI for class data management with progressive dropdowns.

**2. Math Results Analysis System (New Project):**
*   **Purpose:** A web-based system for tutors to upload, store, and analyze student math performance (S1-S4, J1-J2). No login, remembers student details, tracks trends, generates revision plans.
*   **Input:** Manual entry or Excel/CSV template for results (Student Name, Location, Level, Subject, Exam Type, Topic, Marks, Total Marks).
*   **AI PDF Analysis (Phase 2):** Allow tutors to upload scanned PDF test papers. AI (GPT-4o vision) will extract questions, marks, and infer topics. Preview and manual editing of extracted data, autosave to Firebase.
*   **Persistent Data:** Store all uploads in a new Firebase Firestore database. Retain history, track improvements/declines, cumulative averages.
*   **Analysis Engine:** Calculate per-topic/overall averages, identify weak (<60%) and strong (>75%) topics (threshold adjustable by tutor). Display with Radar, Bar, Line charts, and Summary Table. Compare current vs. past results.
*   **Revision Plan Generator:** Cross-reference weak/selected topics with a  to suggest PDFs/videos/worksheets. Generate Internal Assessment Tests based on weak or selected topics/subtopics and duration (45min/1.5hr), producing two PDF documents (student/tutor).
*   **Tutor Dashboard:** Filter panel, Analytics View, Revision Plan, Performance History.
*   **Embedding:** Embed under  with consistent styling.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on enhancing the Math Results Analysis System. Specifically, the last completed feature was the implementation of a **dynamic weak performance threshold** in the frontend ().

This feature allows tutors to adjust the percentage (defaulting to 70%) that defines a weak performance for topics in a student's assessment. As the tutor adjusts this slider, the system dynamically updates the identification and categorization of weak and strong topics within the displayed revision plans and assessment generation modal.

**Key changes in  for this feature include:**
-   Adding state for the  (e.g., ).
-   Integrating a slider UI element in the Revision Plans section to allow tutors to modify this percentage.
-   Updating the logic for  to respect the  when initially populating recommended weak topics.
-   Modifying the display logic for topic scores and performance indicators (e.g., color-coding) to reflect the  dynamically.
-   Ensuring the assessment generation modal also considers this dynamic threshold when tutors are selecting topics for a new assessment.

The frontend ( and  commands) was restarted after these changes, and a summary was provided, indicating the successful completion of this specific feature.
