The previous AI engineer successfully established the initial corporate website for Cognition & Competence Consultancy (CCC), incorporating a FastAPI backend and React frontend. A key feature, the AI chat consultant, underwent significant evolution, from basic functionality to advanced lead capture with email/WhatsApp notifications, AI-generated summaries, and flexible conversation flows. The project navigated a critical re-scoping from EDG-centric to a commercial-first digital agency, culminating in the integration of the C³ AI Employees SaaS platform as a hero feature, complete with a Motion.ai-inspired aesthetic and adorable AI employee avatars. The development included extensive UI/UX refinements, robust analytics integration, and the creation of a public Demos hub showcasing live AI chatbot implementations. A comprehensive AI Library was also established for future reuse. The most recent challenge involves a persistent connection failure with the WhatsApp bot, which remains a pending task despite robust underlying logic.

The primary objective was to develop a professional corporate website for Cognition & Competence Consultancy (CCC), a Singapore-based digital transformation agency. It needed to showcase services in digital transformation, AI implementation, and web/app development for SMEs, including grant application support. Key requirements evolved significantly:

1.  **Initial Website:** Seven main pages (Home, About Us, Services, Portfolio, Grants & Funding, Contact, Legal/PDPA/Terms) with a minimal, modern, corporate design (white background, navy + teal accents, rounded elements, specific typography).
2.  **AI Consultant Chat Widget:** Site-wide access, sub-agent routing, lead capture (name, company, email, WhatsApp, project type, goal, timeline), chat summary/full transcript in notifications, email and WhatsApp notifications.
3.  **EDG Lead-Gen Upgrade:** A dedicated EDG focus on the homepage, sticky chat launcher, lead form, How It Works section, EDG-friendly services strip, FAQs, GA4/Meta Pixel tracking, SEO, and CRM webhook placeholder. Later, compliance updates for EDG messaging were mandated.
4.  **Commercial Rebranding & C³ AI Employees:** Reposition CCC as a commercial-first digital agency, not a grant portal. C³ AI Employees was introduced as the flagship SaaS product, requiring a dramatic homepage hero update, a dedicated  subpage (10 templates, pricing, training module), and a modern, playful AI SaaS aesthetic (Motion.ai style, gradients, cute robot icons, role-first hierarchy).
5.  **Demos Hub:** A public  page with sub-pages (, ) to showcase live AI chatbot implementations for tuition centers (RMSS) and e-commerce (M Supplies).
6.  **Branding & Communication:** Implementation of specific CCC logo design (symbol-only for header/favicon, full with name for pages/footer), transparent backgrounds, standardized sizing, and a professional Gmail address ().

The application utilizes a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, designed for modularity and scalability.



*   ****: The central API gateway, handling AI chat, lead capture, and notifications. It integrates LLMs, dynamically adjusts AI agent behavior based on page context, and manages contact/chat lead submissions, including email/WhatsApp notifications. It was updated for EDG compliance, commercial rebranding, and to integrate WhatsApp bot routes.
*   ****: Orchestrates global routing and component rendering. It was frequently updated to include new pages (, , , , ) and integrate global utilities like analytics.
*   ** / **: Provide site-wide navigation and branding. They were continually refined for new page links, promotional banners, and precise CCC logo integration.
*   ****: The core AI chat interface. It captures leads, sends data to the backend, and manages conversation flow. Extensive changes were made for chat summary/transcript handling, less intrusive AI interaction, and dynamic prompt adjustments.
*   ****: Underwent multiple major rewrites, first for EDG lead generation, then for commercial rebranding, and finally to feature the C³ AI Employees platform as its hero section.
*   ****: A new, critical page detailing the C³ AI Employees SaaS platform, including 10 AI employee templates, their descriptions, and related CTAs, styled with a modern AI aesthetic.
*   ****: A new custom component to ensure consistent logo placement, sizing, and styling across all content pages.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was most recently working on resolving critical connection issues with the WhatsApp bot. Despite significant advancements in the bot's intelligence—including robust business recognition for various industries (e.g., e-commerce, retail, education), refined conversational flows that prevent repetition, provide context, and offer progressive clarification, and the integration of promotional messaging for the Year-End AI Automation Promotion—the bot's operational functionality is currently blocked.

The  Node.js service is running, but it is repeatedly failing to establish a stable connection with WhatsApp's servers. This prevents the generation of a QR code, which is essential for re-authenticating the bot's business number (+65 8982 1301) after its session has expired. Attempts to clear old session data and restart the service have not yielded a stable connection, indicating potential external factors such as WhatsApp Web server issues or network connectivity problems.

Consequently, while the bot's logic is fully programmed to offer tailored responses, provide pricing information, schedule consultations, and hand off leads, it cannot actively process incoming messages on WhatsApp. The  page on the frontend displays a disconnection status but is unable to provide a QR code due to these underlying connection failures.

Continue diagnosing the persistent Connection Failure errors affecting the WhatsApp bot and attempt to restore its connectivity to generate a QR code for re-authentication.
