The previous AI engineer successfully established the initial corporate website using FastAPI and React, progressively enhancing an AI chat consultant to support lead capture, notification, and dynamic content. The project navigated a significant re-scoping towards a commercial-first digital agency, leading to the integration of the C³ AI Employees SaaS platform and a public Demos hub. The immediate work in this trajectory involved rebranding the RMSS tuition center demo to a generic Tuition Centre, fixing a demo connection issue, updating the AI system message with detailed Math transition and calendar information, resolving UI button contrast, and implementing a global error handler for external browser extensions. Currently, the primary focus is on meticulously extracting and structuring all tutor and class data from provided PDFs to populate a new Firebase data layer, a crucial step for the chatbot's comprehensive factual responses.

The overarching goal was to create a professional corporate website for Cognition & Competence Consultancy (CCC), a digital transformation agency. Key requirements included:
1.  **Initial Website:** Core pages (Home, About Us, Services, Portfolio, Grants, Contact, Legal, Terms) with a minimal, modern corporate design.
2.  **AI Consultant Chat Widget:** Site-wide access, sub-agent routing, lead capture with comprehensive fields, chat summaries, and email/WhatsApp notifications.
3.  **EDG Lead-Gen Upgrade:** Dedicated homepage focus, sticky chat, lead forms, How It Works section, analytics (GA4/Meta Pixel), SEO, and CRM webhook.
4.  **Commercial Rebranding & C³ AI Employees:** Repositioning CCC, featuring C³ AI Employees as a flagship SaaS product with a dedicated page, AI employee templates, pricing, and a playful AI aesthetic.
5.  **Demos Hub:** A public  page showcasing live AI chatbot implementations for various industries, specifically a tuition center (initially RMSS) and e-commerce.
6.  **Branding & Communication:** Specific CCC logo usage, standardized sizing, professional contact.
The current work focuses on the Demos Hub, specifically the tuition center chatbot, which requires removing RMSS branding, updating AI training with 2026-2027 Math transition and calendar data, enhancing context memory, and migrating comprehensive tutor and class data to Firebase for robust querying.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently engaged in a meticulous, systematic data extraction process from all provided PDF documents (P2-J2 levels) to build a comprehensive database for the tuition center chatbot. This involves accurately capturing tutor names, subjects, class schedules, locations, and pricing, with a refined data structure that accounts for unique tutors and class assignments, including multiple sessions per class. The goal is to correct previous partial extractions and ensure the dataset is complete and precise. So far, Primary levels P2, P3, P4, P5, and P6 have been extracted. The process is ongoing, with the AI now extracting data for Secondary S1 level, working towards populating the Firebase Firestore with accurate, queryable information for the chatbot.
