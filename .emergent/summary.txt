The previous AI engineer's work pivoted significantly from enhancing a Math Results Analysis System and Tuition Centre Chatbot to building Project 62, a new fitness and nutrition micro-brand application. Initially, efforts for the Math Analysis System focused on tutor authentication, data isolation, and UI refinements. However, the core of the trajectory details the build-out of Project 62 from scratch. This involved setting up a FastAPI backend with Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Storage) and a React frontend. Key tasks included integrating Stripe and SendGrid, creating the landing page, handling lead capture, implementing digital product and meal-prep checkout flows, and addressing numerous user feedback loops, particularly concerning email delivery, payment redirects, form validations, and routing. The process involved extensive  configuration, API router creation, component development, and debugging payment and email integration issues.

The project encompasses two main products:
1.  **Tuition Centre Chatbot:** Aims for data accuracy, enhanced intelligence (multi-turn context, clarifying questions), UI/UX improvements (mobile responsiveness, enrollment form), and new features like an enrollment/reservation form and basic admin UI for class data.
2.  **Math Results Analysis System:** A web-based system for tutors to upload, store, and analyze student math results. Features include trend tracking, revision plan generation, assessment test creation, and a personalized tutor dashboard with filtering and analytics. Recent requirements added tutor management (admin page for creation, password reset), tutor login with first-time password change, strict data isolation per tutor, dynamic dashboard content, and CRUD operations for revision plans.

The primary focus shifted to **Project 62 (Health & Fitness Micro-brand):** This new module, built as an extension of the existing CCC Digital ecosystem, supports sustainable weight management.
*   **Core Functionality:** Inspire through transformation story, lead generation via a free digital guide, sell digital meal-plan products, run a full meal-prep subscription business, and include customer login portal and admin dashboard for CRM/delivery tracking.
*   **Website Structure:** One-page scroll layout (+ pop-up lead form & login page), optimized for mobile. Includes Hero, The 62 Journey, 60-20-20 Philosophy, Digital Guides & Programs, Meal-Prep Subscription, Why Project 62 Works, Testimonials, Contact & Socials sections.
*   **Lead Capture:** Name, Email, (optional) Phone form, saving leads to database, auto-emailing free guide PDF via SendGrid, tagging lead status.
*   **CRM/Backend:** Lead management (view/export CSV), Order & Delivery management (collecting details, auto-assigning delivery weeks, tracking status, generating delivery lists), Customer Login Portal (email+password/magic-link, plan status, address updates, re-order/extend, upgrade plans).
*   **Admin Dashboard:** Tabs for Leads, Orders, Deliveries, Customers.
*   **Payment:** Stripe (digital plans, subscriptions) + static PayNow QR (manual payment for now). Delivery fee 0/week.
*   **Database:** Firebase Firestore under root collection  for , , ,  collections.
*   **Authentication:** Firebase Auth for customer/admin login, JWT based. Admin users have  flag.
*   **Storage:** Firebase Storage for PDF guide and media files.
*   **Design:** Matte Black (#111111), Fresh Green (#00b894), Montserrat/Poppins font.
*   **Routing:** Initially requested to be on  (root), then reverted to .
*   **Specific Fixes/Improvements:** Ensure email delivery, correct date validations for meal prep (3-day lead, no Sat/Sun), correct payment redirects, proper address form for Singapore only, add heating instructions, and resolve  mismatch.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was systematically addressing critical bug reports and implementing new features for **Project 62**.
The latest work focused on resolving two persistent issues:
1.  **Email Sending for Digital Products and Meal-Prep Subscriptions:**
    *   Previously, emails were not being sent due to a  error from SendGrid.
    *   The root cause was identified as a mismatch between the verified sender email () in SendGrid and the  environment variable () in .
    *   This mismatch was corrected, and the backend was restarted.
    *   Additionally, logic was added to  to ensure the PDF link for digital products is included in the email and that an email is sent to  upon meal-prep subscription purchase.
    *   The link in the email intended to direct customers back to subscribe for meal prep was updated to use .
2.  **Payment Success Redirect:**
    *   The user reported that after payment, the application was not redirecting back to the Project 62 landing page.
    *   The  and  parameters for Stripe checkout sessions in  were updated to explicitly point to  and  respectively.
    *   In the , the redirect logic was made more aggressive, changing from 3 seconds to 5 seconds with a loading indicator to ensure the user is clearly navigated.
The backend was restarted after these changes.
Other completed work includes creating all initial Project 62 pages (, , , ), implementing client-side form validations for meal-prep (Singapore only, date restrictions), and removing the header/footer from Project 62 pages. The application's routing was also reverted from subdomain detection to a fixed  path as per user request.
