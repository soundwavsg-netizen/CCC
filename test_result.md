# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "🔧 CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED - Backend Chatbot Data Logic

    **Problem**: Chatbot providing incorrect information about classes
    1. Location filtering broken - showing all locations instead of tutor's actual locations
    2. Wrong Class A/B labeling - used whenever multiple classes at location, should ONLY use when same tutor has multiple classes of same level/subject
    3. Incomplete schedules - missing session timings
    
    **Fixes Applied** (server.py lines 1287-1385):
    1. **Class A/B Logic Fix**: 
       - Now groups by tutor -> location -> level_subject
       - Only adds 'Class A, B, C' when SAME tutor has MULTIPLE classes of EXACT SAME level AND subject at SAME location
       - For different subjects or single classes, no A/B labels
    
    2. **Location Filtering Fix**:
       - Added explicit instruction to LLM with tutor's actual locations
       - Context now includes: '{tutor_name} ONLY teaches at: {locations}'
    
    3. **Schedule Display Fix**:
       - All schedule sessions now properly joined with ' + '
       - Added critical instruction: 'Always show COMPLETE schedules with ALL session days and times'
    
    **Ready for Testing**:
    Test scenarios:
    1. 'Tell me about Sean Yeo S3 AMath' - should show ONLY Bishan and Marine Parade with complete schedules
    2. 'List all tutors teaching S2 Math at Marine Parade' - should show each tutor WITHOUT Class A/B labels (unless tutor has multiple S2 Math classes)
    3. Any class query - verify all session days/times are displayed
    
    Backend restarted and running. Ready for comprehensive testing."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "🎉 ALL CRITICAL CHATBOT FIXES VERIFIED WORKING

    **COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED** - All 4 test scenarios PASSED:

    ✅ **Test 1 - Sean Yeo Location Filtering**: 
    Query: 'Tell me about Sean Yeo S3 AMath classes'
    Result: Bot correctly shows ONLY Bishan and Marine Parade (Sean Yeo's actual locations). Does NOT mention Jurong, Punggol, or Kovan. Perfect location filtering.

    ✅ **Test 2 - Class A/B Labeling Logic**: 
    Query: 'List all tutors teaching S2 Math at Marine Parade'
    Result: Bot lists 9 tutors (Jackie, John Lee, Leonard Teo, etc.) WITHOUT inappropriate Class A/B labels. Each tutor shows complete schedules with correct pricing. Logic working perfectly.

    ✅ **Test 3 - Complete Schedule Display**: 
    Query: 'Show me all S1 Math classes at Punggol'
    Result: All classes show complete schedules with '+' separator (e.g., 'MON 5:00pm-6:30pm + SAT 4:30pm-6:00pm'). No incomplete schedules found.

    ✅ **Test 4 - J1 Math New 2026 Format**: 
    Query: 'Tell me about J1 Math classes'
    Result: Bot correctly explains new 2026 format (1 lesson/week × 2 hours) with correct pricing ($401.12/month) and shows single session timings.

    **ADDITIONAL VERIFICATIONS**:
    ✅ No technical details exposed (Firebase, database, etc.)
    ✅ Multi-turn conversation context working
    ✅ Session ID functionality working
    ✅ All pricing accurate
    ✅ All schedule formats correct

    **RECOMMENDATION**: All critical chatbot data accuracy issues have been successfully resolved. The tuition center chatbot is now providing accurate, properly formatted information about classes, tutors, locations, and schedules."
